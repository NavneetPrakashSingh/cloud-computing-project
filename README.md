a [Sails v1](https://sailsjs.com) application



### Version info

This app was originally generated on Thu Jun 20 2019 22:18:56 GMT-0300 (Atlantic Daylight Time) using Sails v1.2.1.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@1.16.8`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v1.16.8/lib/core-generators/new). -->

### Description

Our project is based on the real-world scenario, how and what is the process followed when a certain individual goes to purchase a house and for that applies mortgage from certain broker. We have understood the project requirements correctly and are able to take this idea and convert it into a set of web-portals. The individuals here can use these portals to apply for mortgage and then the whole process is followed by taking that mortgage application and then checking if the individual is authentic employee. Then one of the portals takes care of the mediator between the insurance company and certain individual. So, in short, we are helping the individual by providing them the portals where they can see the progress of their mortgage that they applied for a certain commodity; in this case itâ€™s a house.

<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)
